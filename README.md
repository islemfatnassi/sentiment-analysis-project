# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The main goal is to classify tweets based on their sentiments, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Overview

The project employs various NLP techniques for preprocessing and machine learning algorithms to predict the sentiment of tweets. It covers the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning the tweets
   - Removing stop words
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization

2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Using TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**: 
   - Utilizing Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.

4. **Evaluation**: 
   - Measuring the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

5. **Visualization**: 
   - Displaying frequent words in tweets using WordCloud.

## Project Structure

- `Data_mining_sentiments_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code for sentiment analysis, from preprocessing to model evaluation.
